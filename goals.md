Goals for Tok Balance
===================

An Eng/Inter lang. A language with a minimal ish word list, but a grammar precise enough to communicate everything.

* Highly Comparable
    * Easy to compare things
    * And give precise or vague measure

* Non lexicalizing
    * Like toki pona
    * Meanings as descriptions, not specific english word
* Strict Grammar
    * No accidentally mixing up "car" with "building to"
    * Words cannot be mistaken for particles and visa versa
* Minimalish word set
    * Looser than Toki Pona.
    * ~300 words
* Common words should be short
* Logography
    * Writing system 
    * 1 or 2 distinct strokes per word  (3 OK, 4 bad)
    * No dots
* Dependent Clauses
* Solid pronoun system

Goals for Tok Balance
===================

An Eng/Inter lang. A language with a minimal ish word list, but a grammar precise enough to communicate everything.

* Highly Comparable
    * Easy to compare things
    * And give precise or vague measure

* Non lexicalizing
    * Like toki pona
    * Meanings as descriptions, not specific english word
* Strict Grammar
    * No accidentally mixing up "car" with "building to"
    * Words cannot be mistaken for particles and visa versa
* Minimalish word set
    * Looser than Toki Pona.
    * ~300 words
* Common words should be short
* Logography
    * Writing system 
    * 1 or 2 distinct strokes per word  (3 OK, 4 bad)
    * No dots
* Dependent Clauses
* Solid pronoun system


Minimal Word Set
----------------
Take advantage of toki pona's word set and expand it but not more than double

Common Words must be short
--------------------
To make building meaning more pleasant, long words should not be needed all the time.

Unique Grammar Particles
-----------------------------
No other words can be mistaken for the particle roots.

(This was met in the end by making all words follow a phonetic structure, that makes it impossible to overlay two words on another)


Pronouns match previous word position.

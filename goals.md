Goals for Dugi Bialan - A language of Balance
===================

Reason To Exist
------------

I have created this language as a response to my experience learning Toki Pona, with the intent to find a place of balance between minimalism and successful communication.

Toki pona is a great language for minimalist communication, and since learning it with my children we have had a lot of fun, however, in my experience, while Toki Pona is easy to speak, it is not easy to understand.

This is because of four main reasons.

* Vague words.    

    This is a feature of the language so it's hard to complain about directly, but reading "suno li lon sewi", and thinking it meant "the sun was in the sky", only to find the intent was "a light was above" was painful. this could have been fixed with "ilo suno".

* Phonetic structure    

    It is too easy to mix up one set of words with another because they sound the same.
    ma ni : this place, and mani : wealth sound awefully similar

* Grammatic structure.    

    A common sited example is "ona pana ei tomo tawa mi" "he gives a building to me" or "he gives my car".
    The problem because toki pona structure is compounding words up to a predicate/particle, if you miss the particle, you end up with completely different meaning.

* Not enough pronouns.

    I appreciate the aim of only 1 3rd person pronoun, but when there were two people in the last sentence, I wish to be able to work out which matters.
    Also, "it was dark" should never use "ona". Especially immediately after a sentence introducing a character. This is not necessarily a problem with the limits of toki pona, but common usage defines how a language works.

The aim of Dugi Bialan is to address all of these problems while still maintaining as many of the language goals of toki pona as possible, especially these below
    * A minimalist word set
    * No automatic gendering/plurality especially in pronouns
    * Non lexicalization
        pairs of words not meaning a specific english word, but communicating their own ideas through combination.

That said, I had to put dependent clauses back in, but in a way that holds onto the way of joining particles.

Other Goals
----------------

* No misreading the grammar.

    Vague language is appropriate for a minimalist language, but every listener should be able to hear where one idea ends and the next begins.

* Should not sound too much like Toki Pona.

    This language is build on Toki Pona, however I also want to speak toki pona and I don't want to get mixed up with the languages having too much crossover.

* Minimalist Word Set

    The language of Balance, is not about pure simplicity or minimalism, but about finding the point where minimalism and usability meet.
    
    For the sake of a number, not more than double the words in toki pona top out at 250

* Comparing things and being precise should be possible

    While not a priority, it is worth making comparisons possible without saying something that isn't "true", such as "you're small. I'm big."
    "me big from you" seems a simple fit to me.

* Common words should be short 

    Keep the words we use every other sentence 1 sylable long , allow rarer words to be longer, to have the language sounding natural
    
* A Logography that is quick to write and easy to read.

    I have loved writing in sitelen pona, the logography of toki pona, but some characters are not practical for actual writing, ko, for example takes a lot of effort to write nicely. 

    I have also spent a long time keeping a diary in shorthand, and I want to be able to keep up with my thinking while writing

    For Dugi Bialan I wish to have a logography. And I wish to avoid any wasted strokes, if something can be communicated without completing the shape, do that.

    Radical combinations to communicate an idea is better than an accurate picture.

* Dependent Clauses

    I want to be able to say "the cat that killed my fish has blood on it's hands" and not "a cat killed my fish and has blood on his hands."

* Solid pronoun system
    
    Let pronouns mark the role the indicated person played in the last sentence, so it's easier to continue without forgetting who we're talking about.

    Also have some separate pronouns that can be assigned to main characters of a story.

* Have a body of work big enough to test it all

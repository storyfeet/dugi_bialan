Dugiland Culture
================

Food
----
Fish is popular food, caught mostly in the rivers. The most common is a breed of salmon who breed at the top of mount Uwenegein.

Cooking is largely done by the women in the community, who gather around noon, and begin preparing a meal for that evening, for the whold village.

The evening meal is enjoyed by the whole village together.

People sit at long low tables with an angled stool


Work
-----
While the majority of people do have a specialisation. One day every week the whole community comes together to do a needed job. maybe gather a harvest, maybe build something. What that turns out to be will vary greatly.

If the crew are willing to join in with these things, they may find they can persuade the whole island to look at their boat as a project later on.

Trade
-----

The main unit of trade on the island is shells of a specific type. They are hard to come by, and will require much effort diving. Or can be traded for. Their value is relative to their size.

Often people will trade simple items for simple items, without the need for currency. Metal tools are also considered valuable enough to act as currency.

Most people will like gold, but see it only as an item that can be traded, not a specific value.

Buildings
----------

Buildings are largely made of wood, with thatch rooves. Most walls have small gaps. A few places have raised floors, but the majority of houses have soil as floor, and raised beds which are moved to the middle of the room for sleeping.  They are small, single roomed buildings.

Near the middle of the town, there is a central rooved area.

Dugiland Culture
================

Food
----
Fish is popular food, caught mostly in the rivers. The most common is a breed of salmon who breed at the top of mount Uwenegein.



Work
-----
While the majority of people do have a specialisation. One day every week the whole community comes together to do a needed job. maybe gather a harvest, maybe build something. What that turns out to be will vary greatly.

If the crew are willing to join in with these things, they may find they can persuade the whole island to look at their boat as a project later on.

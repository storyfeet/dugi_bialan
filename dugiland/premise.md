DugiLand -- Premise
=============

Dugiland is a Role-Play-Game, that is a storytelling adventure. Where players take on the roles of a crew of sailor's who have just been shipwrecked onto an island far from any other land.

This game is about learning a language, and a culture. It is not intended to be a combat game, nor to delve into content above PG rating. Both GM and players should bear this in mind when deciding how to act/respond.

The Island's inhabitants all speak a language called Dugi Bialan. They do not speak the language of the sailors, and have no interest in learning it. They are however willing to help these strangers learn to speak their own language, and help them solve their problems, if only they can understand them.

The primary goal of the crew is to repair thier ship, and to sail away, but they may decide together to try to fulfil other goals, or even choose to settle on the island.

The Games-Master's (GM) role is to act on behalf of the inhabitants and speak for them, it is also to describe the situation, and say what happens when the players act.

Players may do "almost" anything the wish in this game, but the GM will set limits based on what seems reasonable to them.  Players for example, cannot fly as the world of this story is not magical in any way.

The majority of tests and challenges in the game will be language based, ie "can I persuade that person to sell me a spear for fishing". "What does this person want me to do?"

Sometimes players may wish to do something that could succeed or fail. The GM will estimate the difficulty, and require the players roll a certain number to succeed.

    <h1>Goals for Dugi Bialan - A language of Balance</h1>


<h2>Reason To Exist</h2>
<p>I have created this language as a response to my experience learning Toki Pona, with the intent to find a place of balance between minimalism and successful communication.</p>
<p>Toki pona is a great language for minimalist communication, and since learning it with my children we have had a lot of fun, however, in my experience, while Toki Pona is easy to speak, it is not easy to understand.</p>
<p>This is because of four main reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vague words.</p>
<p>This is a feature of the language so it's hard to complain about directly, but reading &quot;suno li lon sewi&quot;, and thinking it meant &quot;the sun was in the sky&quot;, only to find the intent was &quot;a light was above&quot; was painful. this could have been fixed with &quot;ilo suno&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phonetic structure</p>
<p>It is too easy to mix up one set of words with another because they sound the same.
ma ni : this place, and mani : wealth sound awefully similar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grammatic structure.</p>
<p>A common sited example is &quot;ona pana ei tomo tawa mi&quot; &quot;he gives a building to me&quot; or &quot;he gives my car&quot;.
The problem because toki pona structure is compounding words up to a predicate/particle, if you miss the particle, you end up with completely different meaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not enough pronouns.</p>
<p>I appreciate the aim of having only one 3rd person pronoun, but when there were two people in the last sentence, I wish to be able to work out which we are refering to. </p>
<p>Also, &quot;it was dark&quot; should never use &quot;ona&quot; as &quot;it&quot;. Especially after a sentence introducing a character. This is not necessarily a problem with the limits of toki pona, but common usage defines how a language works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of Dugi Bialan is to address all of these problems while still maintaining as many of the language goals of toki pona as possible, especially these below</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimalist word set</li>
<li>No automatic gendering/plurality especially in pronouns</li>
<li>Non lexicalization
pairs of words not meaning a specific english word, but communicating their own ideas through combination.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No misreading the grammar.</p>
<p>Every listener should be able to hear where one idea ends and the next begins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should not sound too much like Toki Pona.</p>
<p>This language is built on Toki Pona, however I also want to speak toki pona and I don't want to get too mixed up when speaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimalist Word Set</p>
<p>The language of Balance, is not purely about simplicity or minimalism, but about finding the point where minimalism and usability meet.</p>
<p>For the sake of a number, It should not have more than double the words in toki pona, which would be roughly 250 words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparing things and being precise should be possible</p>
<p>Comparisons should not say something that isn't &quot;true&quot;, such as &quot;you're small. I'm big.&quot;
&quot;me big from you&quot; seems a simple fit to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common words should be short </p>
<p>Keep the words we use every other sentence 1 sylable long , allow rarer words to be longer, to have the language sounding natural</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Logography that is quick to write and easy to read.</p>
<p>I have loved writing in sitelen pona, the logography of toki pona, but some characters are not practical for actual writing, ko, for example takes a lot of effort to write nicely. </p>
<p>I have also spent a long time keeping a diary in shorthand, and I want to be able to keep up with my thinking while writing</p>
<p>For Dugi Bialan I wish to have a logography. And I wish to avoid any wasted strokes, if something can be communicated without completing the shape, do that.</p>
<p>Radical combinations that communicate ideas is preffered to an accurate picture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependent Clauses</p>
<p>I want to be able to say &quot;the cat that killed my fish has blood on it's hands&quot; and not &quot;a cat killed my fish and has blood on his hands.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solid pronoun system</p>
<p>Let pronouns mark the role the indicated person played in the last sentence, so it's easier to continue without forgetting who we're talking about.</p>
<p>Also have some separate pronouns that can be assigned to main characters of a story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a body of work big enough to test it all</p>
<p>Actually get writing done, end hopefully even have others wrigin in it.</p>
</li>
</ul>

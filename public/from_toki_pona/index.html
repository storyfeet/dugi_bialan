    <h1>Coming From Toki Pona</h1>


<h2>Phonology and Phonotactics</h2>
<p>As with many con-langs, the first step was working out the phonotactics for this language.</p>
<p>I had a specific goal in mind of avoiding phonetic ambiguity. The easiest way to do this was to have a set of sounds that can only appear at the end of a word.</p>
<p>This meant having two sets of vowels.</p>
<ul>
<li>One to repeat from the start of a word </li>
<li>One to end the word</li>
</ul>
<p>I had been planning on using mostly Toki Pona words, but this meant a lot of them could not be said with this strict rule set.</p>
<p>In order to help me hear the difference between the Dugi Bialan and Toki Pona. I chose to use voiced consonants instead of unvoiced 'b d g' instead of 'p t k', and instead of just 'n' as a final, I added 's' aswell.</p>
<p>Then I slowly went through each toki pona word and came up with one or two words that could approximate its sound. If I felt that a word carried too wide a meaning, I created two or three words.</p>
<p>Throughout the process of creating words I discovered that the ending vowel wasn't perfect, and it was still possible to have to a set of sounds with two meanings.</p>
<p>Eventually I realized I needed to disallow words that start with 's','n', or 'a'. This meant even more toki pona words were not allowed. I added 'v' as a sound to replace 's' at the start of some words. 'suli' became 'vuli'.  But other words I wanted to keep the 's' so 'suno' became 'esuno'</p>

Primarty Particles
---------

Particles are how dugi bialan marks the beginning and end of compound items. They also declare the role of the following item in the sentence.

These are :
* "i" - subject - followed by a noun.    
dropped if sentence starts with subject
* "wei" - do - followed by a verb
* "li" - is - followed by an adjective, or noun.
* "lon" - in/at - followed by a location, or a state of being
* "ei" - direct object - followed by a noun
* "da" - towards/to/for - followed by a noun
* "dan" - because/from - followed by a noun or adjective
* "weli" - done/complete/already - followed by a verb

It is important to note that the same word can be a noun, verb or adjective.

-- mi wei mugo
.. I eat
?? I DO food

-- mi li mugo
.. I am food

-- mi wei vio ei vio
.. I set alight a fire

-- mi li vio
.. I am hot

-- mi li won vio
.. I am a fire

Sentence Structure
--------------

There is no strict order in a sentence. No particle is always required.

If no particle is given, the first item is assumed to be the subject.

The following sentence has no verb, but is acceptable in dugi bialan:

-- mi da vin ei belesa
.. I give you a stick.
?? I TO you OBJECT stick

"da" is not a verb, but prefixes the target.

Because the target "da" is defined, and the reciever "ei" is defined, the verb can be easily implied.

--------------

Particles may be combined, to create a meaning new meaning

### "li wei" : passive form

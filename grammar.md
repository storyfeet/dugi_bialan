Phonotactics

C (Consonant) : [w,d,b,s,l,dz(z),g,n,m]

Va (Vowel a) : [ e ,ia,  oi, u ]

Vb (Vowel b) : [i, o, io, ei, a  ]

F (Final) : [n,s]


Words cannot start with "a"


Particles
---------

Particles come before the thing they introduce.

Two particles together ct on the same subject
do subject = The subject is a verb
subject do = The subject is a doer of the verb
do object = the object is a verb

There is no strict order on a a sentence, even verbs. 
If no particle is given, the first item is assumed to be the subject.

-- mi li bunia daun wei dawi delo
.. i like swimming
?? I AM good FROM DO go water

-- mi lon delo li bunia
.. I like swimming
?? i AT water AM happy



Questions
---------

The key particle for questions is "agi"

"agi" At the start of a sentence makes it a question. 
If no question words (semi/ani) the question is boolean.

-- agi sina li bonia daum mi? 
.. do you like me? (Are you good from me?)


To ask an information question, "agi" is followed by the particle you wish to know, then put "semi" belonging to that particle. 
Again if that particle would be the subject, the marker "i". it is not needed

-- agi lon semi?    
.. Where

-- agi semi li dawi?
.. Who is going?

-- agi daun semi i sin wei zion.
.. how do you know?

-- agi wei semi i sin gin elein lawau mi
.. What are you doing with my hat?
?? QN DO what SUB you WITH hat me

-- agi gin nasin semi wei pali ei bengo
.. How does one make a car
?? QN WITH way what DO make OB vehicle?

### wei lon : Exist

### iala : Not
"iala" after a particle, says the whole coming particle is false.

The Pronoun "is"

.. The child speaks to the adult. The child is happy.

-- Zan leli li dugi da zan suli. is da li belin buna.

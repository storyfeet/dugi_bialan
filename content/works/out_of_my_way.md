# Sam had a problem, it seemed no matter what he did, wherever he went people, would get in his way.

zan esamm wei luga ei gein egi. is-mon wei buli ei mugi la, is-mon wei giawin ei man mugi la, zan-mudei wei giawin wei uwein lon iasin is-mon.

# Well, not today he thought to himself as he got out of bed, today is going to be different.

go "va-lon esuno dis" is-mon wei esebin da begi lon wei gan-zewi dan zugi liabei. "esuno dis wei guma endei"

# and he came up with a great plan, to make sure nobody would stay in his way.

is-mon wei buli esebin da wei buli veli ei i va-zan wei uwein lon iasin is-mon

# He went to the bathroom to clean his teath, but as he got in there, his sister laura was in the way.

wei giawin lon doimo delo, deso la min egin is-mon bi enon loila lon man dis, lon iasin is-mon.

# "Get out of my way", he said,

go "o wega dan iasin mi" 

# why, asked Laura, but as she said that, some of her toothpaste fell on sam.

zan Loila go "dan vemi". lon wei dugi ei dis la leli goigo gedin wei giawin da guli-guli esamm

# This was it, time to try out out, "Get out of my way"  This time he said it so loudly, and soo forceully that no-one would dare refuse.

dis li dis veli. don wei guma. go "o wega dan iasin mi" i zan Esamm gin ema-vuli ba vuli, ba wiawa, zan va-wei gein uwein gion.

# Laura got out of the way, and sam was able to clean his teeth.

zan Loila wei wega dan iasin, zan Esamm wei gein delo ei gedin.

# When sam arrived at the busstop there was already a line, but sam wanted to be on the bus first.

zan Esamm wei guma da uwein bengo la, li luga ei lena zan vuli. deso la, is-mon wei belin lon bengo lon won.

# He realized everyone there was in his way.

zan muli lon iasin is-mon

# and so he said to them, "Get out of my way"

# "Why?", they said "We were here first"

# So sam tried again "Get out of my way" But this time he said it soo loudly, and soo forcefully that noone would dare refuse.

# And Sam was able to get on the bus first, but noone sat next to him.

# Sam arrived, got into class, and there he sat and waited patiently for lunchtime.

# When he arrived at the cafeteria, the queue was already lined up.

# People were already in his way, "Get out of my way", sam said.

# "why?" said everybody else, "We got here first"

# Sam tried again, "GET OUT OF MY WAY" but this time he said it sooo loudly, and soo forcefully that noone dared refues. not even the dinner ladies.

# Sam sat and ate his food, again noone sat with him.

# After school, coming home off the bus, sam began to walk the rest of his way home, and as he was walking he came to a narrow section.

# But just as he was going down it, someone else was coming down it, the other way.

# Her name was Jane, not that that mattered to sam. All sam could see was that she was in his way.

# And he was about to let her know, when suddenly. "Get out of my way", she said to him. 

# "No", said sam, "YOU get out of my way" 

# Jane tried again, "Get out of my way", this time, so loudly and soo forcfully that noone would dare refuse.

# Sam dared. He wasn't backing down from this.  "Get out of my way" he said".

# And soo it continues, going back and forth, each one getting louder thn the last, and neither willing to back down.

# And they are still there, to this very day.

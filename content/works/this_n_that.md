I need to tell you something, Not all magicians are completely honest.

# mi li wei belen dugi mugo da vin.

Sometimes they use their magic to trick you.

So watch out.

One Time I was walking down the road, minding my business, when a man approached me.

He asked me if I'd like to make a little money, and of course I said "yes", I do like money.

He had three cards, All I had to do, he said was to keep my eye on one of them.

He had "this" card, "this" card, and "that", put down a pound, he said, if you can find, that card, I'll give you two back.

As he said this he put 1 card on the bottom.

Easy I said, it's the bottom card.

Sorry, he said, this is "this" card.

Tell you what, why don't you have another go. You got 50.50 odds here.

So I did, I tried the top card.

Sorry, not this one either. why don't you have another go.

Another go?? Surely not, I can't get it wrong now.  

So I did, it had to be the middle card, but he showed me again this was still "this" card.

I asked, what happened to that card? 

He said "it's on the bottom. tell you what, why don't you look for this card instead, there are two of them, and you know where 'that' card is already."

I couldn't get this wrong.

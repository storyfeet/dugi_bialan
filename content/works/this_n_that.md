# I need to tell you something, Not all magicians are completely honest.

mi li wei belen dugi mugo da vin. zan bi iasin oimi va-li dugi vuli muli.

# Sometimes they use their magic to trick you.

lon don mugi i zan dis wei elo ei oimi da wei eniasa ei zan, ei vin.

# So watch out.

# One Time I was walking down the road, minding my business, when a man approached me.

lon don won la. mi wei giawin lon iasin, wei esebin ei zo mi la, zan mon wei guma da mi.

# He asked me if I'd like to make a little money

is-mon wei o dugi mi go "vin wei va-wei belin luga ,ei miani"

# and of course I said "yes", I do like money.

mi dan veli go "dan veli, miani li buna da mi"

# He had three cards, All I had to do, he said was to keep my eye on one of them.

is-mon wei luga ei lebo busi van. mi o va-deso lugin bog ei won.

# He had "this" card, "this" card, and "that", put down a pound, he said, if you can find, that card, I'll give you two back.

is-mon wei luga ei lebo "dis", ei lebo "dis" ei lebo "das". go "o bena lon zugi ei miani Enlis won. devin la mi wei gein dugi ei lebo das li lon vemi esi, is-mon da mi wei bena ei miani di.

# As he said this he put 1 card on the bottom.

lon wei dugi ei dis la, is mon wei giawin ei lebo da oiga.

Easy I said, it's the bottom card.

Sorry, he said, this is "this" card.

Tell you what, why don't you have another go. You got 50.50 odds here.

So I did, I tried the top card.

Sorry, not this one either. why don't you have another go.

Another go?? Surely not, I can't get it wrong now.  

So I did, it had to be the middle card, but he showed me again this was still "this" card.

I asked, what happened to that card? 

He said "it's on the bottom."

"Tell you what, why don't you look for this card instead, there are two of them, and you know where 'that' card is already."

I couldn't get this wrong.

"Ok the top one"

"Sorry, no that's that card. One more go"

"The middle then"

"Sorry no that's that card too"

At this point I said, OK, I know your cheating. You have three that cards"

He said "No, I have three "this Cards" This, THis and this.

Tell you what he said, let's get you your money back. Hows this : Double or nothing.

I have This card here, That Card Here. All you have to do is tell me what the last card is, and you get all your money back.

What do you think it is.

I thought this card, but he said. "You know in life, you always get a bit of this, a bit of that, but you also get a bit of the other.

And that's the story of how I lost Â£10

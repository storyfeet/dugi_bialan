# Ok, lets get started, here I have a rope and a magic wand.

# Sir, does this look to you to be about half way along the rope?

# Ok, if you could just take that pair of scissors and make a snip at that half way point.

# -- you just tied a knot

# what do you mean I just tied a knot?

# what would it take to convince you that this knot is a magic know.

# I know, what if I make it disappear? 

# watch closely, see it's gone.

# no, sorry that was just a joke. 

# Ok try again.

# ah yes it just moved along the rope, just a joke.

# Ok, for real this time.

# But I'm sure you're wondering where the know is.

# It's in my hand.

# thankyou very much.

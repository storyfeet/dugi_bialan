# For this I need a volunteer

# Sir what's your name.

# Do you have a scisors health and safety certificate?

# Do you mind if while we're performing this we accidently cut your head off?

# Ok, lets get started, here I have a rope and a pair of scissors.

# Sir, does this look to you to be about half way along the rope?

# -- yes

# Ok, if you could just take that pair of scissors and make a snip at that half way point.

# Lovely, now if you could give back the scissors, for my safety you see.

# Now what we've done here is we started with 1 piece of rope. Where did the second piece come from?  Nobody knows.

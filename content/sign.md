# Luga Belan


Dugi Bialan also has a Sign Language associated with it WIP, that codifies every word.

The goals of the Sign Language are:

* To be as useble as the spoken language
* To help people remember vocab with gesures that match.

Every Dugi Bialan Word has a Luga Bialan Equivilant, so the whole language can be communicated in Sign, as though it were spoken, with just one hand.

Prefixes Particles may be signed with the other hand at the same time as the item they prefix, this is not required however.

In general, particles and prefixes will be performed with the left hand, and may overlap the actions of the right. An action done "down right" across the body is ne

Key

- shape(handshape,?point-direction,?palm-direction) 
- dir(a,b) : Fingers pointing towards 'a', palm facing toward 'b'
- circle(a,b): Move in directoin 'a', then 'b', then complete the circle.
- on(a,b) : place # 'a' above 'b'
- sides(a,b,distance) : Two actions 'a' and 'b', side by side. 
- half(action) : use one hand for two handed 'action'
- both(action) : Do the same acton with both hands
- tap(a?,b,ta?,tb?, repeat = 1) : actions 'a' and 'b' tap against each other at points 'ta', and tb', 'repeat' times.
- rotate(shape,dir,point): rotate 'shape' to new 'dir' turning about 'point'.  

Radicals
-------- 

The radicals used to create write vedin belan, are matched to hand motions.  The majority of characters in vedin belan are a combination of 2 radicals, and we have 2 hands, so, it is normally possible to create signs that match the radicals.
A radical can be a shape motion or position,  and when combined a shape and motion can create a word

Shorthand
------

For numbers from 10 to 99. put the hand with the 10's palm forward, and the hand with the 1's face backward.

To communicate yes no questions, "wei-va-wei" is applied to the particle. In sign language shake the particle up and down, and turn your head sideways to mark the question.

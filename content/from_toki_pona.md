## If you love Toki Pona so much, why mmake a new one?

I have wanted to make a language like Dugi Bialan, for a long time, but I did not have the skills/knowledge needed to put it together until I found Toki Pona. Most notably, how simple a framework can be to still achieve soo much, and how different "morphemes" (units of meaning) can be broken up so effectively, even while being different lengths.

Learning Toki Pona, has taught me many things, and I have used them to make Dugi Bialan. I have also made many direct imports, so Dugi Bialan is 100% a Tokiponido. That is, a child language of Toki Pona. It could not exist without the hard work that jan Sonja put into making Toki Pona.

That said, this langauge deviates from Toki Pona wildly in many places, and I wanted to explain why. 

- Dropping Back to English
    
    My main reason for doing this is that I don't want to have to drop back to English while speaking another language.
    
    Some concepts are made deliberately tricky in Toki Pona such as Numbers and Time, in order to help us relax about them. But I'M NOT RELAXED, I need to know time exactly at all times.
    
    Other concepts that can be described in one English word, take a whole Toki Pona sentence. 
    
    If I have to use English Words when communicating, I might as well just speak English.

- Ambiguity not Vagueness.
    
    Toki Pona can be vague, choosing to give less information that you naturally would in English ("soweli" is just animal not cat/dog/cow), adding extra detail later if needed, but sometimes the ambiguity was too much for me. 
    
    - "mi pana e tomo tawa sina": Is that "I give you my house" or "I give your car"?
    - "ona li moku" Does he eat? or is he food? 
    
    I'm happy with the vagueness, but the ambiguity was too much.

- Phonotactical Ambiguity
    
    I listen to toki pona music on spotify, and often I couldn't find the boundaries between words like: "mani" vs "ma ni", "pi pipi" vs "pipi pi" etc. "jan lili li pona" vs "jan li lili pona" 
    
    Toki Pona uses "Stress" to disambiguate, but in songs, that's often harder to hear.

- I REALLY wanted dependant clauses
    
    This is probably my sorest point, but Toki Pona has to tools to create dependent clauses, but refuses. "pi li" / or "of does", would work so well to enable a phrase like the following.
    
    "soweli pi li moku e kala mi li luka e telo sijelo lon luka ona"
    
    The animal OF DO eat my fish, has blood on it's hands
    
    My efforts to use this kind of phrasing were not well recieved on the forums. Fair enough perhaps. It's not my language, I can't just flip and change it as I want.

"But my own language could be", I said "I'm going to build my own [ language ] with blackjack and hookers" (and where "pi" can introduce a dependent clause.)

Incidentally, {{qoth "liazi"}}:"blackjack" and {{qoth "eselin"}}:"hooker"

## A language of Balance

I wanted to keep as much of the simplicity of Toki Pona as I could, but I wanted to be able to express some common things simply that, in Toki Pona, might take more than 4 words, or even a whole sentence.

I decided my new language would be a "Language of Balance" {{qoth "dugi bialan"}}. Its goal would finding a place where I kept the features of Toki Pona I love, but balanced them with ability to communicate clearly.

For Example:

* Simple Phonotactics
    
    It should be as easy as possibly for anyone on the world to make all the sounds needed.
    
    But now balanced with making word boundaries easy to find.

* A Minimalist Word set
    
    A small word set is easy to learn, and being forced to use this set, simplifies how you think about things, and communicate.
    
    But balanced this with a need to describe common concepts quickly, or use them as a base for other words.
    
* Non Lexicalisation    
    
    Combined words, should not (for the most part) become single words, but instead describe concepts, that "might" be translated as single words in another language.
    
    But balanced with sometimes needing to be specific/precise.

* No gramatically unavoidable information.
    
    Concepts like gender, time and plurality, should not be forced on the speaker. 
    
    eg "he/she", "I went/I will go", "car/cars". In English it is hard to avoid putting in this information.
    
    But balanced by allowing the speaker to add this information when they wish. (Toki Pona does this one well enough)

* Inclusive pronouns
    
    No-one should feel they can't be addressed kindly, or have to fight to be welcomed.
    
    But balanced with the need disambiguate sentences.
    

## If I'm creating a new langauge anyway, I might as well fix the problems I see


Maybe a few cleared grammar rules would really help the listener know what's happening.

Maybe if we could easily hear where each word ends, that would help people follow the story.

### Simple Phonotactics - Clear word boundaries

This has a surprisingly simple fix.

You have a set of sounds, one of which must appear exactly once per word.

You could do this at the start or the end, or even in the middle. I chose the end.

Every word in dugi bialan ends in one of the following sounds.

    'a' 'an' 'as'    
    'o' 'on' 'os'     
    'i' 'in' 'is'
    'ei' 'ein' 'eis'

And does not have these sounds elsewhere.  There are a separate set of vowels that may be repeated throughout the rest of the word.

    'oi' 'ia' 'e' 'u'

Because some of these sounds glide. I had to dissallow words from starting with an "a" to avoid a problem after words ending with an 'i'.  I also dissallowed "n" or "s", from the start of words for the same reason.

Then, because I wasn't paying attention, I allowed the "i" at the start of words. But since there are only three possible words that start with "i" it wasn't a big problem. This is the language of "Balance" not "Perfection" after all. I like the words I already have that start with an 'i', and even though "goigo" can collide with "go i go", the later is grammatically very unlikely.

### Minimalist Word Set - with Helpful Words added

I wanted Dugi Bialans word list to have echos of Toki Pona, but also be distinct enough that it was easy to know which I was speaking. I still want to speak Toki Pona sometimes.

Instead of 't', 'k', and 'p', I opted to use their voiced equivilents, in order 'd', 'g', and 'b'. This meant that even if the words were similar, I'd be saying different words in each language to help me know which I was supposed to be speaking.

Moving words across was not always as easy as you might expect. The stricter phonotactics, meant that many Toki Pona words, simply could not be said within Dugi Bialan rules.

"awen" - stand/wait - for example, has an 'a' at the beginning, and 'en' on the end. so I had to switch out the vowels, 'ewan' would have been acceptable, but at that time, I hadn't yet allowed 'a' at the end of words, so I settled on 'uwein'.

"tomo" - Structure / building - actually has several meanings, and I really wanted to separate them, because vehicles are really common, and rooms are inside buildings. So "tomo" became three/four words.

- doimo - room
- mengi - building
- bengo - vehicle (some Tokiponists use "pingo")
- mesuni - institute ("tomo sona" can be "mesuni zon")

"telo" - Water  Liquid

- delo - Water
- devo - Milk - now "cheese" is "lego devo"
- deli - other liquid / oil

### Minimalist Words - but Roles allow more meaning

In Toki Pona, "li", isn't so much a word, as a marker, when verb/adjective begins. But I wanted to know if I was dealing with an adjective or a verb.

So as well as {{qoth "li"}} which would mark adjectives, I added {{qoth "wei"}} to mark verbs. This had some big advantages, and in several cases allowed one word in Dugi Bialan to cover two distict Toki Pona words.

for example {{qoth "elo"}} = "kepeken", and "ilo"

{{qoth "dis wei elo"}} - this uses -- or --
{{qoth "dis li elo"}} - this is a tool

{{qoth "mi li vi"}} : I am hot  -- or --
{{qoth "mi wei vi"}} : I heat

### No more ambiguity

If a word is an "ad-position" such as {{qoth "da / gin / dan"}} it is never used as a noun/verb/adjective.

So {{qoth "mi wei bena ei mengi da vin"}} "I a house to you", connot be confused with {{qoth "mi wei bena ei mengi giawin vin"}} "I give your moving building".

You can tell if someone is eating or food because these are different

-- {{qoth "mi li mugo"}} : I am food      
-- {{qoth "mi wei mugo"}} : I eat



### Inclusive Pronouns

A big part of the role of "He" and "She" in English is to help the listener know which of two people did a thing, "he said, she said". It's helpful to have a bit of extra info to narrow this down, but it doesn't have to be locked on Gender. 

In Dugi Bialan, it can be anything. {{uqoth "is"}} must be followed by an adjective or a noun, and can be any word that helps to disambiguate between two people/things.

{{qoth "is-zan"}} : The person ( He / She / They)    
{{qoth "is-zo"}} : The thing ( it )    
{{qoth "is-mon"}} : The male ( He / They (m))    
{{qoth "is-min"}} : The female ( She / They (f))    
{{qoth "is-mudei"}} : The many ( They )    
{{qoth "is-vuli"}} : The big ( He / She / They )    
{{qoth "is-won"}} : The one / The first     
{{qoth "is-buna"}} : The good     
{{qoth "is-egi"}} : The bad (found more than once in my diary)    


### Precision and numbers

In toki Pona, it's possible to use "hand","many", and "all" to represent the numbers 5, 20, and 100, which allows some larger numbers, but not clearly distinct.

In Dugi Bialan I wanted numbers, but I did want to guard the simplicity of Toki Pona. So aiming for balance I chose words for:

- 1 : {{qoth "won"}} 
- 2 : {{qoth "di"}}
- 3 : {{qoth "van"}}
- 4 : {{qoth "mo"}}
- 5 : {{qoth "lan"}}
- 20 : {{qoth "in"}}
- 100 : {{qoth "za"}}

The number sounds are all short, and with practice become quite easily chainable to make larger numbers.

{{qoth "in-za-in-di"}} : 2023

You can now name any element, using "edin [number]", eg {{qoth "edin lan van"}} (Oxygen) and while most people do not know all the atomic numbers, you do not need to leave the language for precision.

## So this is Dugi Bialan.

I hope this gives a good grasp on why it exists, and some of my journey to creating it.

It's not finished yet, I still have plenty of work to do to make it ready.  If you'd like to speak it with me, or work with me on some of it's niggles. I'd love to hear from you. [matt.storyfeet@gmail.com](mailto:matt.storyfeet@gmail.com)

I'm aware many of the problems I see in Toki Pona, are features, and it's possible I have missed some of the point,

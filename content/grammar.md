Grammar
======

Overview
-------

Dugi Bialan is a minimalist language seeking balance between simplicity and minimalism with ease of communication, for both speaker and listener.

To aid the listener each type of word is only used as 1 of these things, and does not get mixed as others.

The language has 5 types of words.
* Particles (PAR)
* Conjuctions (CON)
* Auxiliary (AUX)
* Prefixes (PRE)
* Everything else.


Primary Particles
---------

Particles are how dugi bialan marks the beginning and end of compound items. They also declare the role of the following item in the sentence.

These are :
* "i" : subject : followed by a noun.    
dropped if sentence starts with subject
* "wei" : do : followed by a verb
* "li" : is : followed by an adjective, or noun.
* "lon" : in/at : followed by a location, or a state of being
* "ei" : direct object : followed by a noun
* "da" : towards/to/for : followed by a noun
* "dan" : because/from : followed by a noun or adjective
* "weni" : done/complete/already : followed by a verb
* "go" : saying/quote : followed by the quoted clause (use "")
* "boina" : before : followed by a noun
* "devin" : before : followed by a noun


It is important to note that the same word can be a noun, verb or adjective.

-- mi wei mugo    
.. I eat    
?? I DO food

-- mi li mugo    
.. I am food    

-- mi wei vi ei vi    
.. I set alight a fire

-- mi li vi    
.. I am hot

-- mi li won vi    
.. I am a fire

Sentence Structure
--------------

There is no strict order in a sentence. No particle is always required.

If no particle is given, the first item is assumed to be the subject.

Every particle acts on the following item, and there must always an item following each particle (or particle combination).

Not every has a "verb" in the purist sense. The action can be implied by the other information.

The following sentence has no verb, but is acceptable in dugi bialan:

-- mi da vin ei belesa    
.. I [give] to you a stick.    
?? I TO you OBJECT stick

"da" is not a verb, but prefixes the target.

Because the target "da" is defined, and the reciever "ei" is defined, the verb can be easily implied.

Combined Particles
--------------

Particles may be combined, to create a meaning new meaning

### da li : to be / in order to be

-- mi wei mugo ei beba da li wiawa    
.. I eat vegetables to become strong    
?? I DO eat OBJECT vegetable TO BE strong

### da wei : to do / in order to

.. this person eats to become strong    
?? person this DO food TO DO become strong

### dan wei : from doing / because did

-- mi li buna dan wei giawin delo    
.. i like swimming    
?? I AM good FROM DO go water

?? i AT water AM happy

### gin gin : and with 

-- is-min wei dugi, gin gin luga begi wei ema-egon    
.. She spoke, and,  with her hand, drummed.    


### "li wei" : passive form

Verb that happened to subject

The following item exists, it is not the subject or object.

### lon wei : In the middle of

Conjuctions
----------

Conjunction words define a relationship between the clause before it, and the clause after.  If the subject is the same, it doesn't need to be indicated on both sides.

* la : while / because / junction
* esi : if
* boina : before
* devin : after

-- mi wei giawin la, vin o gein uwein    
.. since I'm going, you can stay

-- mi wei giawin esi, vin o gein uwein    
.. If I go, you can stay.

-- me wei giawin boina, vin wei gein uwein     
.. before I go, you can stay

-- me wei giawin devin, vin wei gein uwein    
.. after i go, you can stay

The first clause can be something as simple as a "dis"

-- dis devin, me giawin    
.. after this I'm going



Yes or No Questions
---------

Yes or no questions, are asked by using the "particle not particle" structure

-- vin li va-li buna dan mi?     
.. do you like me?     
?? you ARE not-ARE good FROM me

To answer "yes", is "li", and "no" is "va-li"

-- vin wei va-wei giawin?    
.. Are you going?    
?? you DO not DO go

"yes in this case is "wei", and "no" is "va-wei"

information questions
----------------

To ask an information question, simply replace the information you with to know with "semi".

If possible put "semi" in the first item of the sentence, though this is not a strict requirement.

-- lon semi?        
.. Where

-- semi wei giawin?    
.. Who is going?

-- dan semi i vin wei zon.    
.. how do you know?

-- wei semi i vin gin elein liawa mi    
.. What are you doing with my hat?    
?? DO what SUB you WITH hat me

-- gin iasin semi wei buli ei bengo    
.. How does one make a car    
?? WITH way what DO make OB vehicle?

Numbers
--------
Build numbers use hyphens to show they are still the same number

Number words are : 
* won : 1
* di : 2
* van : 3
* mo : 4
* lan : 5
* in : 20
* za : 100

A low number before a higher number is a multiplies it.  100 multiplies by everything before it.



1 - 4: won, di, van, mo     
5 - 9 : lan, lan-won, lan-di, lan-van, lan-mo    
10 - 14 : di-lan, di-lan-won, di-lan-di , di-lan-van, di-lan-mo    
15 - 19 : van-lan, van-lan-won, van-lan-di, van-lan-van, van-lan-mo    
20 : in    
25 : in-lan    
30 : in-di-lan    
35 : in-van-lan    
40 : di-in    
45 : di-in-lan    
50 : di-in-di-lan    
55 : di-in-van-lan    
1225 : 2-5-2-100-20-5 (12 hundred and 25) = di-lan-di-za-in-lan    

Auxiliary Particles
---------
Auxiliary particles have a special job to do but their role is unlike any other character and have special rules for each of them.

They are:
* bi : of
* deso : except / but / however
* aini :  or

### bi

bi has two main jobs

* Seperate items. 
* Dependent clauses

Normally a noun or adjective is defined as 

A B C -> meaning (A of B) of C

but if we add a 'bi' we get

A bi B C -> A of (B of C)

compare :

zan miani lili - (man of money) of small - the small wealthy money

zan bi miani lili - man of (money of small) - the poor man.

For dependent clauses.

'bi' can be followed by any other particle, and becomes something close to "that"

vo-zuwi **bi wei** moili ei gela mi [la] li luga ei guli-delo lon luga is-vo.

The 'cat', that killed my fish, has blood on it's hands.

### deso - Except/But

Deso can be used like a particle to mean except

-- mi wei mugo muli deso gela    
.. I eat everything except fish

It can be used with negation to mean only or just. the va can apply to the particle or to deso directly

-- mi va-wei deso mugi ei gela
-- mi wei va-deso mugi ei gela    
.. I only eat fish

-- mi wei mugi va-ei deso gela dis
-- mi wei mugo ei va-deso gela dis    
.. I'm eat only this fish

-- me wei bena ei dis va-da deso vin
-- me wei bena ei dis da va-deso vin
.. I give this to only you

### iani - or / choice



Prefix Particles
----------------

Prefix Particles do not break the flow of meaning, but are always followed by another word that completes them. Because of this "bi" is not needed. in the romanisation, it is appropriate to hyphenate the join.

these are : 
* edi : taste
* edin : atom 
* ema : Sound
* ga : colour 
* geni : shape 
* guli : body part
* is : pronoun 
* megi : distance
* va : negator
* vo : animal

When joined to themselves, they mean the concept they cover.
* va-va : none
* ga-ga : Colour

When joined to each other the child prefix has its own clarifier

* ga-(vo-ezan) : Wolf-coloured
* ga-(vo-vo) : Animal colour

### The Pronoun "is"

"is" is the general pronoun for anyone or anything in a previous sentence. It is always followed a clarifying word disambiguate. 
The clarifier doesn't have to be first/main word, just the least ambiguous.

#### Simple clarifiers

* is-mudei : they : the group of people
* is-muli : they all 
* is-zan : this/these person(s)
* is-leli : The small one

#### is-zo, The General It*

The general "it", such as "It's raining" "It's dark" "there is" "It is required"

* is-zo : it / the sky / the world / generic it

-- is-zo li ga-va-zo
.. It's dark

#### Possesive instances

"Mine", as opposed to "My thing". Does not need an object specified as conversation already implies that.

* is-mi : mine
* is-vin : Yours
* is-is : his/her/theirs / belonging to the subject

#### Labeled Pronouns

* is-won : Main character
* is-di : Second main character
* is-van : Third main character

These pronouns can be assigned using to following phrase

    <person> is-<number> la

-- zan Elenuna is-won la, li buna    
.. Elenuna, who we shall call is-won is/was good


### "va"

"va" before a particle, says the whole coming particle is false.

-- mi va-wei giawin
.. I'm not going / I don't go

-- dis va-li buna    
.. this is not good

-- mi va-wei zon
.. I don't know

"va" before a verb is equivelant to "un" in english

-- mi wei va-zon     
.. I unknow / I forget

-- va-o va-zon
.. don't forget

* va-va : none
* va-zo : nothing
* va-deso : only
* va-zon : forget

### Colours with "ga"

Describe colours how you like, but these are some good starters.

* ga-ga : colour
* ga-won : uniform colour
* ga-gon : transparent
* ga-va-zo : black 
* ga-va-va : colourless
* ga-esuno : yellow/orange
* ga-delo : blue
* ga-zewi : light-blue
* ga-una : red
* ga-beba : green
* ga-goigo : brown

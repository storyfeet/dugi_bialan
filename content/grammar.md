Grammar

Overview
-------

Dugi Bialan is a minimalist language seeking balance between simplicity and ease of communication, for both speaker and listener.

To aid the listener each type of word is only used as 1 of these things, and does not get mixed as others.

The language has 5 types of words.
* Particles (PAR)
* Conjuctions (CON)
* Prefixes (PRE)
* Bi (of)
* Everything else.




Primary Particles
---------

Particles are how dugi bialan marks the beginning and end of compound items. They also declare the role of the following item in the sentence.

These are :
* "i" : subject : followed by a noun.    
dropped if sentence starts with subject
* "wei" : do : followed by a verb
* "li" : is : followed by an adjective, or noun.
* "lon" : in/at : followed by a location, or a state of being
* "ei" : direct object : followed by a noun
* "da" : towards/to/for : followed by a noun
* "dan" : because/from : followed by a noun or adjective
* "weni" : done/complete/already : followed by a verb
* "go" : saying/quote : followed by the quoted clause (use "")

It is important to note that the same word can be a noun, verb or adjective.

-- mi wei mugo
.. I eat
?? I DO food

-- mi li mugo
.. I am food

-- mi wei vio ei vio
.. I set alight a fire

-- mi li vio
.. I am hot

-- mi li won vio
.. I am a fire

Sentence Structure
--------------

There is no strict order in a sentence. No particle is always required.

If no particle is given, the first item is assumed to be the subject.

Every particle acts on the following item, and there must always an item following each particle (or particle combination).

Not every has a "verb" in the purist sense. The action can be implied by the other information.

The following sentence has no verb, but is acceptable in dugi bialan:

-- mi da vin ei belesa
.. I [give] to you a stick.
?? I TO you OBJECT stick

"da" is not a verb, but prefixes the target.

Because the target "da" is defined, and the reciever "ei" is defined, the verb can be easily implied.

Combined Particles
--------------

Particles may be combined, to create a meaning new meaning

### da li : to be / in order to be

-- mi wei mugo ei beba da li wiawa
.. I eat vegetables to become strong
?? I DO eat OBJECT vegetable TO BE strong

### da wei : to do / in order to

.. this person eats to become strong
?? person this DO food TO DO become strong

### dan wei : from doing / because did

### gin gin : and with 

-- zezi wei dugi, gin gin luga bagi wei geliama

### "li wei" : passive form

### "lon li" : Exists / There was / There is

The following item exists, it is not the subject or object.

-- lon don won lon li zan 
.. Once, there was a person
?? AT time one AT is person

### lon wei : In the middle of

.. I'm in the middle of talking


### wei gin : use

?? you DO WITH me DO build OBJECT building you

### wei li : become / turn into

-- vin wei li vo-vo
.. You become an animal

-- vin wei li vo-vo ei mi
.. you turn me into an animal


Conjuctions
----------

Conjunction words define a relationship between the clause before it, and the clause after.  If the subject is the same, it doesn't need to be indicated on both sides.

* la : while / because / junction
* esi : if
* boina : before
* devin : after

-- mi wei giawin la, vin o gein uwein
.. since I'm going, you can stay

-- mi wei giawin esi, vin o gein uwein
.. If I go, you can stay.

-- me wei giawin boina, vin wei gein uwein 
.. before I go, you can stay

-- me wei giawin devin, vin wei gein uwein
.. after i go, you can stay

The first clause can be something as simple as a "dis"

-- dis devin, me giawin
.. after this I'm going



Negation "va"
------------

"va" after a particle, says the whole coming particle is false.

-- mi wei va giawin
.. I'm not going / I don't go

-- dis li va buna
.. this is not good

"va" after the verb is equivelant to "un" in english

-- mi wei zion va
.. I unknow / I forget

-- o va zion va
.. don't forget



Yes or No Questions
---------

Yes or no questions, are asked by using the "particle not particle" structure

-- vin li va li buna dan mi? 
.. do you like me? 
?? you ARE not ARE good FROM me

"yes" in this case would be "li", and "no" would be "va" or "li va"

-- vin wei va wei giawin?
.. Are you going?
?? you DO not DO go

"yes in this case is "wei", and "no" is "va" or "wei va"

information questions
----------------

To ask an information question, simply replace the information you with to know with "semi".

If possible put "semi" in the first item of the sentence, though this is not a strict requirement.

-- lon semi?    
.. Where

-- semi wei giawin?
.. Who is going?

-- dan semi i vin wei zion.
.. how do you know?

-- wei semi i vin gin elein liawa mi
.. What are you doing with my hat?
?? DO what SUB you WITH hat me

-- gin iasin semi wei buli ei bengo
.. How does one make a car
?? WITH way what DO make OB vehicle?

Numbers
--------
Build numbers use hyphens to show they are still the same number

Number words are : 
* won : 1
* di : 2
* van : 3
* mo : 4
* lan : 5
* in : 20
* ziaza : 100

A low number before a higher number is a multiplies it.  100 multiplies by everything before it.



1 - 4: won, di, van, mo 
5 - 9 : lan, lan-won, lan-di, lan-van, lan-mo
10 - 14 : di-lan, di-lan-won, di-lan-di , di-lan-van, di-lan-mo
15 - 19 : van-lan, van-lan-won, van-lan-di, van-lan-van, van-lan-mo
20 : in
25 : in-lan
30 : in-di-lan
35 : in-van-lan
40 : di-in
45 : di-in-lan
50 : di-in-di-lan
55 : di-in-van-lan
1225 : 2-5-2-100-20-5 (12 hundred and 25) = di-lan-di-ziaza-in-lan



Prefix Particles
----------------

Prefix Particles do not break the flow of meaning, but are always followed by another word that completes them. Because of this "bi" is not needed. in writing it is appropriate to hyphenate the join.

Joined to themselves, they mean the concept they cover.

* is : pronoun 
* ga : colour 
* geni : shape 
* vo : animal
* edin : atom 
* guli : body part
* edi : taste


### The Pronoun "is"

"is" is the general pronoun for anyone or anything in a previous sentence. It is always followed a clarifying word disambiguate, that may be a Primary particle. 

If a primary particle follows "is", then the most recent occurence of that particle is assumed to be the intended target.

.. The child speaks to the adult. The child is happy.

-- Zan leli li dugi da zan vuli. is-da li belin buna.

Primary Particles
---------

Particles are how dugi bialan marks the beginning and end of compound items. They also declare the role of the following item in the sentence.

These are :
* "i" : subject : followed by a noun.    
dropped if sentence starts with subject
* "wei" : do : followed by a verb
* "li" : is : followed by an adjective, or noun.
* "lon" : in/at : followed by a location, or a state of being
* "ei" : direct object : followed by a noun
* "da" : towards/to/for : followed by a noun
* "dan" : because/from : followed by a noun or adjective
* "weni" : done/complete/already : followed by a verb
* "go" : saying/quote : followed by the quoted clause (use "")

It is important to note that the same word can be a noun, verb or adjective.

?? I DO food

-- mi li mugo
.. I am food

-- mi wei vio ei vio
.. I set alight a fire

-- mi li vio
.. I am hot

Sentence Structure
--------------

There is no strict order in a sentence. No particle is always required.

If no particle is given, the first item is assumed to be the subject.

The following sentence has no verb, but is acceptable in dugi bialan:

-- mi da vin ei belesa
.. I give you a stick.
?? I TO you OBJECT stick

"da" is not a verb, but prefixes the target.

Because the target "da" is defined, and the reciever "ei" is defined, the verb can be easily implied.

35 : in-van-lan
40 : di-in
45 : di-in-lan
50 : di-in-di-lan
55 : di-in-van-lan
1225 : 2-5-2-100-20-5 (12 hundred and 25) = di-lan-di-ziaza-in-lan

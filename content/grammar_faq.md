## {{with_pics "benon belin i benon luga " " : "}} : Want / Must / Would like

I want and I feel are actually surprisingly similar. 

eq : I feel like running / I want to run.

English idea -> dugi bialan

* I want to do -> I do feel .. -> mi wei belin ..
* I feel .. -> I am feel .. -> me li belin ..

Obligation on the other hand, is something wanted of you.

* I have to .. -> I am wanted .. -> m li wei belin ..
* I have to .. -> I am have .. -> mi li luga da ..

In a very broad strokes sense, "want" is more an active verb, and "feel" is more a state of being.

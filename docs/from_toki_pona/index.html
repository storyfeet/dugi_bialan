    <h1>Coming From Toki Pona</h1>
    <div class="content">
        
<h2>If you love Toki Pona so much, why change it.</h2>
<p>I have long wanted to make a language like Dugi Bialan, but I did not have the skills/knowledge needed to put it together before I met Toki Pona. My previous attempts are nothing to write home about/in.</p>
<p>Learning Toki Pona taught my many things, and as such Dugi Bialan is a Tokiponido, a child language of Toki Pona, as it could not exist without the hard work that jan Sonja put into making Toki Pona.</p>
<p>That said, this langauge deviates from Toki Pona wildly. My main reason for doing this is that I don't want to have to leave the language I'm speaking to communicate effectively. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Toki Pona, precision was basically impossible</p>
<p>We'd be at the park and the kids would ask, &quot;tempo li semi&quot;/&quot;what time is it&quot;. Giving the hour was fine, but not the minutes.</p>
<p>Toki Pona deliberately makes this precision difficult, to persuade us to relax. But I'm not relaxed, I can't cope without it. So I had to drop back to English.</p>
<p>Sat at the dinner table, we'd struggle to ask for anything, because everything was the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grammatical Ambiguity was too wild</p>
<p>Does &quot;mi pana e tomo tawa sina&quot; mean &quot;I give you my house&quot;, or &quot;I give your car&quot;. These are wildly different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phonotactical Ambiguity</p>
<p>In songs (yes I still listen to toki pona music on spotify), I couldn't hear the difference between &quot;ma ni&quot; and &quot;mani&quot;, or find the boundaries between other words&quot;</p>
<p>Toki Pona uses &quot;Stress&quot; to disambiguate, but in songs, that's often harder to hear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does he eat, or is he food</p>
<p>&quot;ona li moku&quot;</p>
<p>It's hard to tell an adjective apart from a verb. There are tools, like adding a direct object or an owner.</p>
<p>&quot;ona li moku e kili&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;ona li moku sina&quot;</p>
<p>But not every verb has a direct to object fix this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I REALLY wanted dependant clauses</p>
<p>This is probably my most sore point, but Toki Pona has to tools/words to do this, but refuses.</p>
<p>&quot;soweli pi li moku e kala mi li luka e telo sijelo lon luka ona&quot;</p>
<p>The Cat which ate my fish, has blood on it's hands</p>
<p>I'll accept this is personal preference, but to me that &quot;pi&quot; does the what I want, but the Toki Pona community I met, somewhat dissagree.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In frustration, I said, &quot;that's it, I'm going to build my own [ language ] with blackjack and hookers&quot; (and where &quot;pi&quot; can introduce a dependent clause.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, &quot;  &quot; (' liazi '):&quot;blackjack&quot; and &quot;  &quot; (' eselin '):&quot;hooker&quot;</p>
<h2>If I'm creating a new langauge anyway, I might as well fix the problems I see</h2>
<p>Dugi Bialan means &quot;Language of Balance&quot;. I love the simplicity of Toki Pona, but a few convenience words would really help in some places.</p>
<p>Maybe a few cleared grammar rules would really help the listener know what's happening.</p>
<p>Maybe if we could easily hear where each word ends, that would help people follow the story.</p>
<h3>Phonotactic ambiguity.</h3>
<p>This has a surprisingly simple fix.</p>
<p>You have a set of sounds, one of which must appear exactly once per word.</p>
<p>You could do this at the start or the end, or even in the middle. I chose the end.</p>
<p>Every word in dugi bialan ends in one of the following sounds.</p>
<pre><code>'a' 'an' 'as'    
'o' 'on' 'os'     
'i' 'in' 'is'
'ei' 'ein' 'eis'
</code></pre>
<p>And does not have these sounds elsewhere.  There are a separate set of vowels that may be repeated throughout the rest of the word.</p>
<pre><code>'oi' 'ia' 'e' 'u'
</code></pre>
<p>Because some of these sounds glide. I had to dissallow words from starting with an &quot;a&quot; to avoid a problem after words ending with an 'i'.  I also dissallowed &quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot;, from the start of words for the same reason.</p>
<p>Then, because I wasn't paying attention, I allowed the &quot;i&quot; at the start of words. But since there are only three possible words that start with &quot;i&quot; it wasn't a big problem. This is the language of &quot;Balance&quot; not &quot;Perfection&quot; after all. I like the words I already have that start with an 'i', and even though &quot;goigo&quot; can collide with &quot;go i go&quot;, the later is grammatically very unlikely.</p>
<h3>Softer Sounds</h3>
<p>I still want to speak Toki Pona, and learning a fork of it makes it tricky to know what comes from what. I already have enough trouble with French and Spanish. How much worse if I used the same sounds/words from Toki Pona.</p>
<p>Instead of 't', 'k', and 'p', I opted to use their voiced equivilents, in order 'd', 'g', and 'b'. This meant that even if the words were similar, I'd be saying different words in each language to help me know which I was supposed to be speaking.</p>
<h3>Creating Words</h3>
<p>I wanted to be able to say everthing I could in Toki Pona, so it seemed sensible to start with Toki Pona words, and just move them across to Dugi Bialan.</p>
<p>This was not always as easy as you might expect. The stricter phonotactic rules I created meant that many Toki Pona words, simply could not be said within Dugi Bialan rules, (Though most dugi bialan words, can be said in Toki Pona).</p>
<p>&quot;awen&quot; - stand/wait - for example, has an 'a' at the beginning, and 'en' on the end. so I had to switch out the vowels, 'ewan' would have been acceptable, but at that time, I hadn't yet allowed 'a' at the end of words, so I settled on 'uwein'.</p>
<p>&quot;tomo&quot; - Structure / building - actually has several meanings, and I really wanted to separate them, because vehicles are really common, and rooms are inside buildings. So &quot;tomo&quot; became three/four words.</p>
<ul>
<li>doimo - room</li>
<li>mengi - building</li>
<li>bengo - vehicle (some Tokiponists use &quot;pingo&quot;)</li>
<li>mesuni - institution (maybe &quot;kulupu&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Doing vs Being</h3>
<p>In Toki Pona, &quot;li&quot;, isn't so much a word, as a marker, when verb/adjective begins. But I wanted to know if I was dealing with an adjective or a verb.</p>
<p>So as well as &quot; &quot; (' li ') which would mark adjectives, I added &quot; &quot; (' wei ') to mark verbs. This had some big advantages, and in several cases allowed one word in Dugi Bialan to cover two distict Toki Pona words.</p>
<p>for example &quot;&quot; (' elo ') = &quot;kepeken&quot;, and &quot;ilo&quot;</p>
<p>-- &quot; &quot; (' dis wei elo ') - this uses
-- &quot; &quot; (' dis li elo ') - this is a tool</p>
<p>(I also slightly expanded &quot;kin&quot; &quot;&quot; (' gin ') to include &quot;using&quot; )</p>
<p>-- &quot; &quot; (' mi li mugo ') : I am food
-- &quot; &quot; (' mi wei mugo ') : I eat</p>
<h2>Precision and numbers</h2>
<p>In toki Pona, it's possible to use &quot;hand&quot;,&quot;many&quot;, and &quot;all&quot; to represent the numbers 5, 20, and 100, which allows some larger numbers, but not clearly distinct.</p>
<p>In Dugi Bialan I wanted numbers, but I did want to guard the simplicity of Toki Pona. So aiming for balance I chose words for:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 : &quot;&quot; (' won ') </li>
<li>2 : &quot;&quot; (' di ')</li>
<li>3 : &quot;&quot; (' van ')</li>
<li>4 : &quot;&quot; (' mo ')</li>
<li>5 : &quot;&quot; (' lan ')</li>
<li>20 : &quot;&quot; (' in ')</li>
<li>100 : &quot;&quot; (' za ')</li>
</ul>
<p>The number sounds are all short, and with practice become quite easily chainable to make larger numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;&quot; (' in-za-in-di ') : 2023</p>
<p>You can now name any element, using &quot;edin [number]&quot;, eg &quot;&quot; (' edin lan van ') (Oxygen) and while most people do not know all the atomic numbers, you do not need to leave the language for precision.</p>

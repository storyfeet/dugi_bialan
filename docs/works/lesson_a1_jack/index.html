<h2>Chapter 1 - A curious trade</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' ma min ') : Mother (Parent Female)</li>
</ul>
<p>Jack and his 
lived in a small house with their cow, and very little money.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' man esin ') : Market (Place of trade)</li>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' esin ') : sell/trade</li>
</ul>
<p>One day, his 

and 
her for money.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;  &quot; (' zan Zagg ') : Jack ( Person Jack ) </li>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' zan ') : Person</li>
</ul>
<p> 

, but on the way, he met a strange 
.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' zi beba ') : beans ( Child of vegetable)</li>
</ul>
<p>This 
had with him some 
. He said to   
that he would 
his 
, for the cow.</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked   
, &quot;a cow is worth much more than 
&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' lugin ') : Look / See</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;
at these beans&quot;, replied the 
, &quot;these 
are magic. Just plant them in your garden and 
what happens&quot;.</p>
<p>  
really wanted to 
, so he 
the cow to the 
in exchange for </p>
<p>  
took the 
excitedly back to his </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot; &quot; (' wei ') : Do/Did (Comes before verbs)</li>
</ul>
<p>His 
was not so excited. she  
take the 
from   

throw them on the rubbish pile.</p>
<p>She then  
sent    
bed without any supper, and later  
went  
bed herself.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' giasi ') : tree</li>
</ul>
<p>During the night,  
began to grow into a tall 
By the morning they  
touched the sky.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' bi ') : of (separates groups of words)</li>
</ul>
<p>  
and his  
at the 
coming out of the rubbish pile.</p>
<p> 
say. &quot;I wonder what's at the top of that 
. </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot; &quot; (' ei ') : Direct Object Marker. (Marks what the verb happens to)</li>
</ul>
<p>She commanded Jack to climb    
what's at the top&quot;</p>
<p>   
started 
. It was a hard climb. When he reached  
top, he was exhausted.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' gein ') : able / can</li>
</ul>
<p>He  
around him, and to his surprise he &quot;  &quot; (' wei gein lugin ei ') giant castle.</p>
<p>&quot;How did that  
get here?&quot; he  
asked himself.&quot; </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' vuli ') : Big</li>
</ul>
<p>He walked  
it and  
that it was much more 
than he had realized.</p>
<p>&quot;How 
I get in?&quot; he  
asked himself, but then he   
small gap under the door, 
enough for someone small like him to climb through.</p>
<p>Once he was inside, he looked and, on the table 
he saw a hen. He  
from around the corner as a  
speak  
hen saying &quot;Lay&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' don ') : Time / Moment / Hour</li>
</ul>
<p>At that 
the Hen  
laid  
egg that was pure gold.</p>
<p> 

egg,  
cooked  
ate.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' giawin ') : go / move</li>
</ul>
<p>   
thought  
himself, &quot;I  
need to get me  
that hen&quot;. He waited until  
then snuck onto the table   
grabbed  
hen,  
back  </p>
<p>As he  
neared the top, he  
heard the  

after him.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' is-mon ') : him / his (as adjective after a noun)</li>

<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' mugo ') : food / eat</li>
</ul>
<p>

golden eggs for months.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2 - Another visit.</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' vis ') : New / Again / Re-</li>
</ul>
<p>Much later, at     

<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' is-min ') : She / Her</li>
</ul>
<p> 

<p>   
began 
to climb the 

<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' bi wei ') : That does / of doing</li>
</ul>

<p>   
say to the harp &quot;Play&quot;, and &quot;Stop&quot; and realized   
wanted it.</p>
<p> 
waited   
before  
climing onto the table  
taking the harp,  
away.</p>
<p>But the harp  
called out, and  
chased after         
down the 
.</p>
<p> 
down behind   
. But    
reached the bottom first.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' din ') : Cut</li>
<li>&quot;&quot; (' elo ') : Tool / Use</li>
</ul>
<p> 

returned with the &quot;&quot; (' elo din giasi '), and zan Zagg wei began din.</p>
<p> 
fell with a mighty crash, and 
with it.</p>
<p>That was the end of 
.</p>
<p>As for   
and 
. They  
lived a quite life,   
golden egg sandwiches, to the beautiful sound of a harp, thinking nothing of </p>

Sam had a problem, it seemed no matter what he did, wherever he went people, would get in his way.</p>
<p>                                         <br />
Well, not today he thought to himself as he got out of bed, today is going to be different.</p>
<p>                       <br />
and he came up with a great plan, to make sure nobody would stay in his way.</p>
<p>                                   <br />
He went to the bathroom to clean his teath, but his sister laura was there.  There in Sam's way.</p>
<p>            <br />
&quot;Get out of my way&quot;, he said,</p>

why, asked Laura. As she said that, some of her toothpaste fell on Sam's clothes.</p>
<p>                                                         <br />
This was it, time to try out out, &quot;Get out of my way&quot;  This time he said it so loudly, and soo forceully that no-one would dare refuse.</p>
<p>                           <br />
Laura got out of the way, and sam was able to clean his teeth.</p>
<p>                                            <br />
When sam arrived at the busstop there was already a long line, but sam wanted to be on the bus first.</p>
<p>                <br />
He realized everyone there was in his way.</p>
<p>            <br />
and so he said to them, &quot;Get out of my way&quot;</p>
<p>                    <br />
&quot;Why?&quot;, they said &quot;We were here first&quot;</p>
<p>                                                      <br />
So sam tried again &quot;Get out of my way&quot; But this time he said it soo loudly, and soo forcefully that noone would dare refuse.</p>
<p>                              <br />
And Sam was able to get on the bus first, but noone sat next to him.</p>
<p>                      <br />
Sam arrived, got into class, and there he sat and waited patiently for lunchtime.</p>
<p>                             <br />
At lunchtime, when he arrived at the cafeteria, the queue was already long.</p>
<p>                         <br />
People were already in his way, &quot;Get out of my way&quot;, sam said.</p>
<p>                   <br />
&quot;why?&quot; said everybody else, &quot;We got here first&quot;</p>
<p>                                                               <br />
Sam tried again, &quot;GET OUT OF MY WAY&quot; but this time he said it sooo loudly, and soo forcefully that noone dared refues. not even the dinner ladies.</p>
<p>                           <br />
Sam sat and ate his food, again noone sat with him.</p>
<p>                                              <br />
After school, coming home off the bus, sam began to walk the rest of his way home, and as he was walking he came to a narrow section.</p>
<p>                        <br />
But just as he was going down it, someone else was coming down it, the other way.</p>
<p>                                     <br />
Her name was Jane, not that that mattered to sam. All sam could see was that she was in his way.</p>

Jane tried again, &quot;Get out of my way&quot;, this time, so loudly and soo forcfully that noone would dare refuse.</p>
<p>                                <br />
Sam dared. He wasn't backing down from this.  &quot;Get out of my way&quot; he said&quot;.</p>
<p>                                          <br />
